Branch: A pathway of file changes within Git that encapsulate an idea. A branch is created when someone working on the project wants to clone a specific file and make changes to it without changing the entire thing.
Clone: To make a replica of a file in order to work on a different idea on the same file.
Commit: To package up all the edited files in one neat package and get it ready to push to your repository.
Fetch: A Git command to look at any changes that were made by people working on the project.
GIT: A software for tracking code changes within a project so that a group can work on it together remotely and combine their efforts.
Github: A website used to store repositories and display projects.
Merge: A way to combine someone's branched ideas with the main project so that both ideas are integrated.
Merge Conflict: When someone tries to push their changes to the repository but it ends up creating code or version conflicts within the project. For example, attempting to edit code that someone else is already editing will create a merge conflict.
Push: To push a commit to the repository and update the files in it to reflect all your work
Pull: A Git command to match local files to the remote repository by downloading them and making sure you are using the most updated version.
Remote: A repository that is separate from your local files. It allows you to have a saved version of a file or project so that it can be worked on at different times and is able to be branched off. 
Repository: A folder that contains many files and potentially several versions of those files. It allows several people to work on the same project together by having a common database from which they can pull from.
